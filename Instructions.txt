There are 2 folders one named Annarr jörd and another named Interaction.

Folder named Annarr jörd is the main unity project.
	- Open this folder using unity version 2020.2.7f1 and the scene to be used is called AnnarrJörd.unity
	- Play to watch the cinematic using the game window

Folder named Interaction is the website for the interaction where the users are going to choose the ending, along with the database.
	- finaleoption.sql is the file to create the database
	- Folder named finaleoption is the folder containing the php files for the website
		- index.php is the main file containing the code for the website
	- To vote click on the desired button and it is submitted automatically onto the database.

* For now the second endig is still not optimized, that's why the interaction is just limited to one ending *
* The connection to the database is working well but commented for testing purposes *
